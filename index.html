            <h3>Interdimensional Skirmisher.</h3>
            <p>
                Wraith is a whirlwind fighter, able to execute deadly attacks and manipulate spacetime by opening rifts
                in the fabric of reality — but those abilities came at a price. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC
                detention facility with no memory of who she was. Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey, who volunteered as
                guinea pig for her own experiments... whose partner betrayed her and locked her away… no longer existed.
                All that was left was a timid girl, frightened by a cacophony of voices in her head, until another
                version of herself appeared and taught her to listen to the voices. Following her lead, Wraith found the
                strength to break free from her prison and escape into a different reality - this reality.

                Finally free, but still robbed of her memories, Wraith continues her quest to learn more about who she
                was before the experiments. With so many of the Apex Games held on old IMC bases, Wraith now competes so
                she can access the mysterious facilities and learn more about who she was. She remains a fixture of the
                Apex Games, and with every match she gets closer to the truth...
